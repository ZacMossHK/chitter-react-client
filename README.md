# Chitter Client

**The front-end client to Chitter, a social media web application.**

***This is still in progress!***

Users can create accounts, log in and out, make posts (called Peeps), like posts, and tag users in posts. Tagged users will be emailed at the address supplied when they create their account.

## Design

For my initial designs I used Excalidraw to experiment and quickly sketch out thoughts for how pages should look. I settled on a two-panel layout that seperated user information and posting interactions from the Peeps timeline. I then finalised those designs in Figma.
